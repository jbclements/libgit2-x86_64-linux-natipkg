# Deprecated: `libgit2-x86_64-linux-natipkg`

This repository contains the deprecated Racket package
`libgit2-x86_64-linux-natipkg`. Use the
[`libgit2-native-libs`](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/libgit2-native-libs)
meta-package instead of this package. Even better, use the
[`libgit2`](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/libgit2) package,
which provides Racket bindings, rather than depending on the native
library packages directly.
